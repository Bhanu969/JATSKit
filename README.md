oXygenJATSframework
===================

oXygen XML Editor framework for NISO JATS 1.0 / NLM BITS

NISO JATS 1.0 is the current version of the NLM Journal Publishing,
Archiving and Authoring DTDs. This oXygen framework supports editing
JATS documents along with BITS 0.2, the NLM book DTD specification
(in draft, November 2012). Included are DTDs optimized for oXygen,
CSS files for authoring in oXygen, and stylesheets (XSLT) for 
production of HTML and PDF (preview) outputs.

To install, copy the 'jats' directory into the 'frameworks' directory
of your oXygen installation, and you should be good.
